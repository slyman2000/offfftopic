    "Munich exudes Bavarian charm. Beer fanatics should head immediately to the Hofbräuhaus, a hops heaven that’s been churning out the good stuff since 1589. The drinking is downright legendary during Oktoberfest, a celebration of local beers and German specialty foods. Emulate world-class athletes at the Olympiapark, where skating on the Olympic ice rink will make you feel like a champion. The promenade of Marienplatz is perfect for people watching and gawking at the Glockenspiele of City Hall[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1). \n",
    "In Munich there are many museums, theaters and offcourse it is well known for a Beer Festival <b>Oktoberfest</b>  with about 6 millions visitors per year. \n",
